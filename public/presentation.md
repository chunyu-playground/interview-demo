# Philosophy of Collaboration on GitHub

- Key activities in collaboration:
    - Communication
    - Contribution
    - Administration
- Key entities for managing collaboration:
    - Individuals
    - Organizations
        - Enable shared **ownership** and **administration** of repositories
        - Example: System and Service Team
    - Teams
        - Groups of users within an organization
        - Example: AE Team, Engineering Team

# About Repositories

- GitHub's core services center around repository functionalities
- Repositories are used to manage work and collaborate effectively:
    - **Issues**: Track bugs, tasks, and discussions
    - **Wiki**: Share documentation or project resources
    - **Discussions**: Facilitate team conversations
- Public vs. Private Repositories:
    - **Public**: Accessible to everyone on the internet
    - **Private**: Accessible only to you, invited collaborators, or organization members
    - Permissions and visibility settings apply to the entire repository, including code, issues, and the wiki

# About Organizations

- Organizations are shared accounts where **multiple members** can collaborate
- Users can belong to multiple organizations
- Permissions are assigned based on roles:
    - **Owner**: Full control over the organization
    - **Member**: Limited access based on assigned permissions
    - **Outside Collaborator**: Access to specific repositories without org. membership
- **Teams**: Sub-groups of members within an organization
    - Control repository access levels (admin, read, or write)
    - Enable organization members to notify the entire team efficiently

# How to Collaborate with External Collabrators

- **Join an Organization**
    - **As Members**: Collaborators are added to the orgnization (teams) 
        - Permissions can be adjusted for all repositories a team has access to
        - Ideal for long-term collaborators requiring access to multiple repositories
    - **As Outside Collaborators**: Collaborators are added  to specific repositories
        - Have no visibility into the broader organization or other repositories
        - Best for temporary or repository-specific access
- **Repository-Level Collaboration**
    - The access level is the same as that of outside collaborators
    - Offers flexibility for **individual** collaboration
