# **Team Up with GitHub**
Effective Teamworking and 
Community Engagement on GitHub

---

# Very Brief Introduction to GitHub

- More than just a repository for teams
    - Software project management
    - Workflow automation (build, deliver, and maintain = CI/CD)
- A social network built for all developers
    - Meet great developers and tech evangelists with your favorite projects
    - Contribute your efforts to make the community vibrant and thrive
- A knowledge base for every learner
    - Online documnetation for projects
    - Learning materials shared by experienced users

# Everything Starts from a Repository

- GitHub’s services are centered around Repository functionalities
- Public Repository vs. Private Repository
- Best practices:
    - Add a README file (a description of the repository)
    - Add .gitgnore (to exclude files that should not be stored in a repository)
    - Choose and review license (to clarify how others can use your work))

# Setting Up Work - Issue, Label, and Milestone

- ***Issue*** is not always a problem; it can also represent tasks or ideas
    - Track the current status of work progress
    - Contribute ideas, feedback, and solutions
    - Report bugs
- Since an ***Issue*** is neutral, a ***Label*** can provide context
    - Makes it easier to categorize and search for ***Issues***
    - e.g., bug, enhancement, question, help wanted
- Each ***Issue*** contributes to a larger ***Milestone***
    - Represents significant moments in the project lifecycle
    - e.g., documentation complete, software module complete, test case complete

# Managing Documentation with Wiki

- A collaborative knowledge management tool
    - Project management documents
    - User manuals
    - System architecture (diagrams)
    - Development guidelines for team members
- Permissions in a Wiki are aligned with Repository settings
- Regular updates are essential for team members and users to access the latest info.

# Community Forum for Repository - Discussions

- Unlike Issues, content in Discussions doesn’t need to be...
    - Tracked on a board
    - Linked to code
    - Closed
- Teams can post announcements, gather feedback, and make decisions
- Visitors and contributors can ask questions, provide answers, and mark solutions
